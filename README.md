# For what

This project is served as the Final project of course PHY 403, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester.

## Method

we use Metropolis algorithm to find the ground state of a 2D Ising system.

We expect the code can realize the following features:
1. High speed and sufficient annealing schedule.
2. Ising model with transversive filed.
3. Track and visualize phase transition by chosing a proper coupling matrix $J$
4. tbc...
